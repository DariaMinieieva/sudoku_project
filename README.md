# Backtracking Project

This is a project made by UCU students:
1. Olha Liuba - crossword solver implementation
1. Hanna Yershova - sudoku solver implementation
1. Victoriya Roi - maze solver implementation
1. Anna-Alina Bondarets - graph colouring algorithm implementation
1. Daria Minieieva - crossword solver implementation

This project uses backtracking as a primary algorithm to solve above problems. Backtracking is an algorithm that seeks for the best option in solving a problem which returns back when the current solution is wrong (backtracks).
